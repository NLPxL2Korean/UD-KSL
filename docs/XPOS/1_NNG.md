### Boundary cases and clarifications

#### Differences with related tags
- **NNG vs. NNP (Proper Noun, 고유 명사):**  
  NNG is used for general nouns, while NNP is reserved for specific names, such as the names of people, places, or organizations.  
  - **NNG**: 사람 (person), 도시 (city), 나라 (country)  
  - **NNP**: 철수 (Cheol-Soo), 서울 (Seoul), 태국 (Thailand)  

#### Compound and affixed forms
- When a noun is part of a compound word or combined with an affix, it should still be tagged as a single NNG if the entire word is listed as a standalone entry in the dictionary.  
  - 비빔 + 밥 = 비빔밥 (NNG)  
  - 영화 + -관 = 영화관 (NNG)  
  - 양- + 식당 = 양식당 (NNG)
