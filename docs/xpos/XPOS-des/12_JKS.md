## JKS: Postposition_nominative (주격 조사)

### Definition
JKS refers to a postposition that attaches to nouns and pronouns to mark the subject in a sentence, functioning as a case marker.

---

### Characteristics
- JKS (e.g., '이', '가', '서') attaches to the subject of a sentence, which represents the agent or entity performing an action or being in a certain state.
- The choice between ‘이’ and ‘가’ depends on the final sound of the preceding noun: ‘이’ is used after a noun ending in a consonant, while ‘가’ is used after a noun ending in a vowel.
- '께서' functions as a subject marker while also adding a respectful or honorific nuance to the referent.
- **Examples**:  
  - 이 책**이** 재미있다.
  - 사과**가** 맛있다.
  - 부모님**께서** 바다에 갔습니다.

### Boundary cases and clarifications

#### Differences with related tags  
- **JKS vs. JKC (Postposition_complement, 보격 조사):**  
  - '이' and '가' can function as both JKS and JKC, but their roles in a sentence differ. JKS marks the subject, which is a core element in every sentence. JKC, on the other hand, marks a complement required by specific predicates such as '되다' and '아니다'.
    - 내**가**(JKS) 선생님**이**(JKC) 되었다. (**I** became a **teacher**.)  
    - 언어를 배우는 것**이**(JKS) 쉬운 일**이**(JKC) 아니야. (**Learning a language** is not **an easy task**.)  

#### Special cases  
- **Double subject constructions:**  
  - Typically, a single predicate has one subject. However, some Korean sentences may appear to have two subjects, and in such cases, both can be tagged as JKS.
    - 나는 친구**가**(JKS)** 좋다.
    - 제**가**(JKS) 계획**이**(JKS) 있습니다. 
    - 3월**이**(JKS) 1월보다 날씨**가**(JKS) 따뜻해.
