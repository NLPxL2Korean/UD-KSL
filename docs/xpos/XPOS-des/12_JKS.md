## JKS: Postposition_nominative (주격 조사)

### Definition
JKS refers to postpositions that attach to nouns and pronouns to indicate various subject roles in a sentence, functioning as a case marker.

---

### Characteristics
- JKS such as ‘이’, ‘가’, and '서' is used with subject elements, which refer to the agent or entity performing the action or being in the state described by the predicate.  
- The choice between ‘이’ and ‘가’ depends on the final sound of the preceding noun:  
  - **'이'** is used after a noun ending in a consonant.  
  - **'가'** is used after a noun ending in a vowel.  
- **‘께서’** marks the subject while also conveying a respectful or honorific meaning regarding the referent.  
- **Examples**:  
  - 이 책**이** 재미있다. (*The book* is interesting.)  
  - 사과**가** 맛있다. (*The apple* is delicious.)  
  - 부모님**께서** 바다에 갔습니다. (*My parents* went to the sea.)

### Boundary cases and clarifications

#### Differences with related tags  
- **JKS vs. JKC (Postposition_complement, 보격 조사):**  
  - '이' and '가' can function as both JKS and JKC, but their roles in a sentence are different. JKS attaches to the subject, which is a fundamental component of every sentence. JKC, on the other hand, attaches to a complement, which is essential for certain specific predicates. 
    - 내**가(JKS)** 선생님**이(JKC)** 되었다. (*I* became a *teacher*.)  
    - 언어를 배우는 것**이(JKS)** 쉬운 일**이(JKC)** 아니야. (*Learning a language* is not *an easy task.*)  

#### Special cases  
- **Double subject constructions**  
  - Typically, a single predicate corresponds to one subject. However, some Korean sentences appear to have **two subjects**. In such cases, both can be tagged as JKS.  
    - 나는 친구**가(JKS)** 좋다.
    - 제**가(JKS)** 계획**이(JKS)** 있습니다. 
    - 3월**이(JKS)** 1월보다 날씨**가(JKS)** 따뜻해.
