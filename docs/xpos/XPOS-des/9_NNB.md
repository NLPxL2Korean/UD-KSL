## NNB: Noun_common_bound (의존 명사)

### Definition
NNB refers to a noun that cannot stand alone with complete meaning and must be modified by a preceding element, such as a predicate stem with a modifier ending or a determiner.

---

### Characteristics
- NNB represents an abstract concept or an unspecified entity, requiring a modifier for a complete meaning.
- NNB also functions as a classifier for units and measurements, used when counting people, objects, occurrences, etc.  
- **Examples**:
  - 내가 말한 **것** (**the thing** I mentioned)  
  - 내가 아는 **바** (**the fact** I know)  
  - Classifier nouns: 년(year), 월(month), 일(day), 시(hour), 명(person)

### Boundary cases and clarifications  

#### Differences with related tags  
1. **NNB vs. NNG (Noun_common, 보통 명사)**  
  - NNB requires an accompanying modifier, so it cannot appear at the beginning of a sentence. In contrast, NNG refers to independent nouns that can function as standalone words.  
    - 그는 **책(NNG)**을 읽는 **중(NNB)**이다.

2. **NNB vs. XSN (Suffix_noun_derivative, 명사 파생 접미사)**  
  - NNB is essentially a noun, so it can be written separately from the preceding word, whereas XSN is an affix and must be written together with the preceding word.  
      - **NNB**: 빌리 **씨**, 낯선 **이**  
      - **XSN**: 사람**들**, 선생**님**  

#### Special cases  
- **Distinguishing NNB from JX (Postposition_auxiliary, 보조사):**  
  - Some NNBs share the same surface form as certain JX, such as 뿐, 대로, and 만큼. They must be distinguished and tagged accordingly. Generally, JX is attached to nouns, whereas NNB is typically followed by a predicate stem with a modifier ending.
      - **NNB**: 선생님이 말씀하신 **대로**  
      - **JX**: 우리 마음**대로**
