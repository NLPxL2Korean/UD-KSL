## VV: Verb_main (동사)

### Definition
VV refers to an action, movement, state, or occurrence as the stem of a verb.

---

### Characteristics
- In Korean, lexical verbs are composed of a stem and an ending. Among these, VV corresponds to the verb stem.
- Fixed-form VV can combine with various types of endings to convey meanings related to tense, mood, and politeness.
  - **Examples**:
    - **먹**다 (eat), **먹**었다 (ate), **먹**습니다 (a polite form of "eat").

### Boundary cases and clarifications

#### Differences with related tags
1. **VV vs. VA (Adjective, 형용사):**
   - While both VV and VA can function as predicates in a sentence, **VV** represents actions or occurrences, whereas **VA** describes the qualities or states of objects.  
   - VV can directly take present tense markers (e.g., -ㄴ/는다), whereas VA cannot.
     - **VV**: 가다 (go), 먹다 (eat)  
     - **VA**: 좋다 (be good), 많다 (be many), 예쁘다 (be pretty)

2. **VV vs. VX (Verb_auxiliary, 보조 동사):**
   - VV functions as the main verb with an independent meaning, whereas VX is used only with a main verb to complement or modify its meaning.  
      - **VV**: 음식을 **먹다** (I **eath** food.)
      - **VX**: 음식을 먹어 **본다** (I **try** eating the food.)

#### Special cases
- **Phonological changes in VV with endings:**
  - When certain endings are attached, VV can undergo phonological changes such as deletion, addition, or modification. In such cases, it is important to preserve the original VV form while parsing the morphemes separately.
    - 바람이 **부니까**: **불**(VV) + -니까  
    - 선생님이 **불러요**: **부르**(VV) + -어요  
    - 길을 **물어** 봐요: **묻**(VV) + -어  
    - 종이를 **주워**: **줍**(VV) + -어
