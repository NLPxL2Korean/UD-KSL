## EF: Ending_closing (종결 어미)

### Definition
EF is a type of verbal ending that indicates the completion of a sentence and conveys the sentence mood at the end of verbal stems.

---

### Characteristics
- EF attaches to a verbal stem and determines the sentence type (e.g., declarative, interrogative, imperative, or suggestive) as well as different speech levels and politeness forms in Korean.
- The following punctuation (e.g., period, question mark, exclamation mark) can reinforce the function and nuance conveyed by EF.
  - **Examples**:
    - 잘 지**낸다** (Declarative)
    - 잘 지내**니**? (Interrogative)
    - 잘 지내**라**! (Imperative)
    - 잘 지내**자**. (Suggestive)

### Boundary cases and clarifications

#### Differences with related tags

- **EF vs. EP (Ending_prefinal, 선어말 어미):**  
  While **EF** finalizes the sentence, **EP** appears before EF to indicate tense or honorific meaning. Generally, Korean verb endings follow the order: verbal stem + EP + EF.  
    - **Examples**:
      - 학교에 **가다**(VV+EF): I go to school.  
      - 학교에 **갔다**(VV+EP+EF): I went to school.

#### Special cases

- **Morphological variations:**  
  - In Korean, the form of an EF can change depending on the final syllable of the verb stem. This must be considered during parsing.  
  - For example, the **"-습니다"** takes the form **"-ㅂ니다"** when the verb stem ends in a vowel or the final consonant 'ㄹ'.  
    - 음식을 **먹습니다**: 먹- + **-습니다(EF)**  
    - 학교에 **갑니다**: 가- + **-ㅂ니다(EF)**

### Examples

- 삼계탕을 먹<ins>**는다**</ins>.

- 잘 지내셨<ins>**습니까**</ins>?  
- 문을 열<ins>**어라**</ins>!  
- 항상 스트레칭을 하<ins>**십시오**</ins>.
