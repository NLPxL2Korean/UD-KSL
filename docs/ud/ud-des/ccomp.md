## ccomp: Clausal complement

### Definition
`ccomp` refers to a clausal complement that functions as a core argument within a sentence, excluding the subject.

### Characteristics
- The ccomp tag is typically used to parse the predicate of a clause that functions as an essential component of the sentence, such as an object or quotation.
- In clauses indicating quotations, the ccomp tag is often composed with JKQ (Postposition_quotative, 인용격 조사).
- **Examples**:
    - 이 직업이 내가 맞는 <ins>**일인지**</ins> 모르겠어요.
    - 친구가 카메라를 <ins>**빌려주세요라고**</ins> 부탁했습니다.

### Boundary cases and clarifications
#### Differences with related tags
- **ccomp vs. csubj (Clausal subject):**  
    - Both ccomp and csubj lead clauses that function as core arguments within a sentence.
    - The essential components of a sentence vary depending on its root, but the subject is always semantically essential. When a clause is essential to the sentence, its predicate is parsed as csubj if it functions as the subject and as ccomp otherwise.
        - **ccomp**: 이름이 <ins>**무엇인지**</ins> 물어보겠다.
        - **csubj**: 처음에 한국어를 <ins>**발음하기가**</ins> 어려웠다.
