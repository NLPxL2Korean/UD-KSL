## case: Case marker

### Definition
`case` refers to a case marker that appears after a sentence element to indicate its grammatical role within a sentence.

---

### Characteristics
- The case tag generally appears as a preposition or postposition following pronouns, nouns, or noun phrases, and it functions as a dependent of these elements.
- In Korean, case markers for key sentence elements, as well as auxiliary postpositions like JX (Postposition_auxiliary, 보조사), are typically attached to the preceding word. However, if they are incorrectly spaced, they should be treated as case tags
- **Examples**:
    - 학교 **앞에서** 친구를 기다립니다.
    - 이틀 **후에** 새 학기가 시작됩니다.
    - 저는 친구 **하고** 여행을 갈 예정입니다.
    - 일부(50%) **는** 찬성이라고 밝혔다.

### Boundary cases and clarifications

#### Differences with related tags
- **case vs. mark (Marker):**  
  - Both the case tag and the mark tag can consist of the same form of NNB (Noun_common_bound, dependent noun), as they function as words that indicate the grammatical role of specific elements.
  - The case tag follows nouns directly, while the mark tag comes after predicates and introduces subordinate clauses.
    - **case**: 한 **시간**(obl) **후에** 식당에 도착합니다.
    - **mark**: 물을 한 컵 **마신**(advcl) **후에** 밥을 먹습니다.
  

#### Special cases
1. **VCP (Copular_positive, 긍정 지정사) as a case tag**
    - '이다' belongs to VCP, functioning as a predicate while also attaching to the preceding word like a postposition. If '이다' is incorrectly spaced from the preceding noun, it should be parsed as a case tag.
        - 빌리 씨는 미국사람 **이다**.
        - 매연은 환경 오염의 원인 **중** 하나 **이다**.
     
2. **Parsing '등' as a Case Marker**
    - In Korean, "등," which means "etc." in English, follows a list of two or more nouns. It either limits the reference to just those items or suggests that there are more similar items.
    - '등' is classified as an NNB in terms of part of speech, but it is parsed as a case because it typically comes after nouns and shows the grammatical relationship between them.
        - 수요일에 국어, 수학, 체육 **등** 수업을 듣는다.
        - 산에서 진달래꽃, 개나리 **등을** 보니 자연이 참 좋다고 생각했습니다.
