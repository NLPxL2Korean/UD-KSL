## dislocated: Dislocated element

### Definition
`dislocated` refers to an element that is distinct from the main subject in a double subject construction.

---

### Characteristics
- In Korean, one sentence can have two subjects that share a single predicate. This is called a "double subject construction." The first subject usually functions as the topic, and the second subject is closely linked to the predicate. In this structure, the first subject is parsed as a dislocated to differentiate it from the second subject.
- The dislocated tag is generally dependent on the root of the sentence.
- **Examples**:
    - **코끼리가**(dislocated) **코가**(nsubj) 길다.  
    - **저는**(dislocated) **나이가**(nsubj) 많아요.

### Boundary cases and clarifications

#### Special cases
- **Parsing sentences that contain both subject and complement**:
    - In Korean, the case marker for nominal complements is the same as for nominal subjects. In sentences with complements (e.g., using '되다' or '아니다'), the complement is tagged as nsubj.
    - There are two ways to tag the subject, complement, and predicate: (1)**dislocated + nsubj + root**, (2)**nsubj + nsubj + root**
        - 그 **사람이**(dislocated/nsubj) **부자가**(nsubj) 되었다.  
        - **나는**(dislocated/nsubj) **학생이**(nsubj) 아니다.
