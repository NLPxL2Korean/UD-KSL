### Characteristics
- The punct tag does not establish syntactic relations but contributes to sentence structure, disambiguation, and readability.
- The punct tag is typically used at the end of a sentence and depends on the root of the sentence. When used in the middle of a sentence, it may depend on the preceding or following unit depending on the context. For example, paired punctuation marks such as quotation marks depend on the unit that serves as the root within the quoted sentence.
