### Characteristics
- The punct tag does not establish syntactic relations but helps structure sentences, resolve ambiguities, and improve readability.
- The punct tag is typically used at the end of a sentence and depends on the root of the sentence. When used in the middle of a sentence, it may depend on either the preceding or following unit, depending on the context. For example, quotation marks, depend on the unit that serves as the root within the quoted sentence.
- **Examples**:
