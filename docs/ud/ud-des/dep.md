## dep: Unspecified dependency relation

### Definition
`dep` refers to a sentence component that is grammatically or semantically incorrect and cannot be assigned a specific UD tag.

### Characteristics
- The dep tag is used when a component is ungrammatical or unclear in meaning. It is usually linked to the root of the sentence.
- The dep tag is a fallback option in the UD system. If the error is a noun, it is tagged as advmod; if it is a verb, it is tagged as advcl. If the part of speech is unclear, it is tagged as dep.
