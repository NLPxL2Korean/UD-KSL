# UD-KSL

This repository contains information for the most recently updated UD_Korea as a second language (UD_Korean-KSL) treebank.
UD_Korean-KSL is a dependency treebank of L2 Korean featuring manual annotations for morphemes and Universal Dependencies.
An official UD treebank is available [here](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Korean-KSL/tree/dev).

On this page, you will find the latest trained models using the UD_Korean-KSL treebank, along with the corresponding documentation.
The updated L2-Korean UD treebank (v1.2) currently comprises 12,984 sentences.
